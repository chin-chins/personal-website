        <p>I've always planned on making my own website at some point, but never really sat down and committed 
        to doing so until recently. Looking around on sites like Neocities and SpaceHey, I was inspired by 
        all the amazing pages people had made for themselves with skills that I always had in my pocket. I knew
        that it was something that I could do, and so I set out to deepen my webdev skills and create an online 
        space to call my own. 
        </p>

        <p>
          As a computer science student, one thing that I hear all the time is "you should have a portfolio website!"
          and "you need to build projects!", and this website is the kind of culmination of those two ideas. 
          It's something that I can show off to employers and friends as a way to demostrate my skills, but 
          also show my personality and interests outside of just computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
          While it'll remain a long long work in progress, this site is something that I look forward to updating
          and working throughout the years :D
