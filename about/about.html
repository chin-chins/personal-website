      <h3>
        about the site and me:
      </h3>

      <p>I've always planned on making my own website at some point, but never really sat down and committed 
        to doing so until recently. Looking around on sites like Neocities and SpaceHey, I was inspired by 
        all the amazing pages people had made for themselves with skills that I always had in my pocket. I knew
        that it was something that I could do, and so I set out to deepen my webdev skills and create an online 
        space to call my own. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As a computer science student, one thing that I hear all the time is "you should have a portfolio website!"
        and "you need to build projects!", and this website is the kind of culmination of those two ideas. 
        It's something that I can show off to employers and friends as a way to demostrate my skills, but 
        also show my personality and interests outside of just computer science.
      </p>

      <p>
        While it'll remain a long long work in progress, this site is something that I look forward to updating
        and working throughout the years :D 
      </p>
