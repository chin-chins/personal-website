        <p>welcome to the frying pan! my name is chi (she/her), and I'm comp sci and comp engineering student 
          that loves creating! this is the very much wip bubble of the internet that i've created for myself 
          and devoted to my interests and hobbies. It's also a portfolio of sorts that combines 
          some of my other work and projects (this being one of them) that I've worked on. 
        </p>

        <p>
          this site is very much a work in progress, so things will change often, but i hope to update it with
          new content and projects over time! feel free to look around and come back often for updates (*￣3￣)╭
